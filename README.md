# B-Treezy

Project for my ALG2 course

## Description 

A simple implementation of a B-Tree data structure. The aim of this project is to learn how this data structure works and to implement it in C++ as a console application.

## Features

- B-Tree implementation: Provides a complete implementation of a B-Tree data structure.
- Insertion and deletion: Allows insertion and deletion of nodes in the B-Tree.
- Searching: Enables searching for specific keys in the B-Tree.
- Visualization: Provides a simple console visual representation of the B-Tree structure.
- Customizable order: Allows customization of the B-Tree order.

## TODO

- Some sort of CLI (so far the project includes only the implementation and API).
- Templated B-Tree (I learned about templates later).
